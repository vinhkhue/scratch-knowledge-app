'''Blocks''' are puzzle-piece shapes that are used to create code in [[Scratch]]. The blocks connect to each other vertically like a jigsaw puzzle, where each block type ([[hat]], [[stack]], [[reporter]], [[boolean]], or [[cap]]) has its own shape and its own slot shape for it to be inserted into. Series of connected blocks are called [[script]]s.

Blocks are often easier to work with than text-based programming, as blocks do not need to be memorized like typed commands and syntax errors cannot occur. However, text-based programming is more flexible, as text can easily be edited without having to drag another block into the editor.

There are ten categories of blocks: [[Motion Blocks|Motion]], [[Looks Blocks|Looks]], [[Sound Blocks|Sound]], [[Event Blocks|Event]], [[Control Blocks|Control]], [[Sensing Blocks|Sensing]], [[Operators Blocks|Operators]],   [[Variables Blocks|Variables]], [[List Blocks|List]], and [[Custom Blocks|My Blocks]]. The list blocks are shown under the Variables Blocks.

In total, there are eight [[Hat Block]]s, five [[C Block]]s, 34 [[Reporter Block]]s, 14 [[Boolean Block]]s, two [[Cap Block]]s and 62 [[Stack Block]]s, for a total of 125 blocks. ''(Block numbers do not include extensions.)''

== Block Shapes ==
There are six different block shapes: [[Hat Block|Hat]], [[Stack Block|Stack]], [[Boolean Block|Boolean]], [[Reporter Block|Reporter]], [[C Block|C]] and [[Cap Block|Cap]].

=== Hat blocks ===
{{main|Hat Block}}
[[File:Hat block grey.svg|thumb|100x100px|The shape of a Hat block.]]
'''Hat blocks''' are the blocks that start every script. They are shaped with a rounded top and a bump at the bottom {{-}} this is so that a user can only place blocks below them. There are eight Hat blocks in the Scratch editor, six of which are in the [[Events Blocks|Events]] category, one in the [[Control Blocks|Control]] category, and one in the category [[My Blocks]] (if one has created one custom block).

=== Stack blocks ===
[[File:Stack block grey.svg|thumb|left|100x100px|The shape of a Stack block.]]
{{main|Stack Block}}
'''Stack blocks''' are the blocks that perform specific commands. They are shaped with a notch at the top and a bump on the bottom {{-}} this is so blocks can be placed above and below them. There are 62 Stack blocks {{-}} the most common block shape.

=== Boolean blocks ===
[[File:Boolean block grey.svg|thumb|100x100px|The shape of a Boolean block.]]
{{main|Boolean Block}}
'''Boolean blocks''' are blocks that act like conditions. They have an elongated hexagonal shape. Boolean blocks can hold and report "true" or "false" values. These blocks are inserted into holes of other blocks with the same shape or the shape of a reporter block (see below).

=== Reporter blocks ===
[[File:Reporter block grey.svg|thumb|left|100x100px|The shape of a Reporter block.]]
{{main|Reporter Block}}
'''Reporter blocks''' are blocks that act as the values. They are shaped with rounded edges. Reporter blocks can hold numbers and [[string]]s. They can also report a [[variable]]. Theoretically, there are an infinite number of Reporter blocks that can be made for each variable and list. These blocks are inserted into holes of other blocks with the same shape.

=== C blocks ===
[[File:C  block grey.svg|thumb|100x100px|The shape of a C block.]]
{{main|C Block}}
'''C blocks''' are blocks that take the shape of "C's". Also known as "Wrap blocks", these blocks loop the blocks within the Cs or check if a condition is true. There are five C blocks, and they can be found in the Control category. C blocks can be bumped at the bottom, allowing blocks to be attached below, or capped, which does not allow any blocks to be placed below.

=== Cap blocks ===
[[File:Cap block grey.svg|thumb|left|100x100px|The shape of a Cap block.]]
{{main|Cap Block}}
'''Cap blocks''' are the blocks that end scripts. They are shaped with a notch at the top and a flat bottom {{-}} this is so blocks cannot be placed below them. There are two Cap blocks, which can both be found in the Control category.

== Block Categories ==
{{main|Block Categories}}
[[File:Block categories with all extensions.png|thumb|70px|The block categories.]]
Blocks are divided into 9 categories: [[Motion Blocks|Motion]], [[Looks Blocks|Looks]], [[Sound Blocks|Sound]], [[Events Blocks|Events]], [[Control Blocks|Control]], [[Sensing Blocks|Sensing]], [[Operators Blocks|Operators]], [[Variables Blocks|Variables]], and [[My Blocks]]. Each category has blocks that perform a different function. There are also 11 [[extension]] categories that can be added to the block list by selecting them, and 3 [[Raspberry Pi]] extensions that are not available on other versions of Scratch. The block categories appear in the categories to the left of the [[Block Palette]], and extensions will appear there when they are added.

== List of Blocks ==
There are 124 normal blocks in Scratch 3.0 (not including extensions or [[Hidden Blocks|hidden blocks]]). There are 80 extension blocks (not including Raspberry Pi blocks). There are also many [[Hidden Blocks]] that cannot be accessed normally.

The following is a list of said 124 blocks, divided and listed based on category:

== Scratch Block Plugin ==
{{main|Block Plugin}}
The Block Plugin allows one to write blocks and scripts to appear on the [[Scratch Discussion Forums|Scratch Forums]] and [[Scratch Wiki]], as well as other websites with the included JavaScript. It is written by the [[Scratcher]] blob8108. The dedicated forum topic for testing this plugin out can be found [[topic:741323|here]].

== In Other Programming Languages ==
Scratch is one of the original languages ever to use blocks, inspiring other languages to inherit the idea. [[Scratch Modification|Scratch modifications]] contain many new blocks typically that are not present in Scratch. [[MIT]], where Scratch is made, has also created other languages using blocks such as the [http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ MIT App Inventor]. [http://www.stencyl.com Stencyl] is a highly-professional language that features an entire block interface for programming real-time apps and online games. [[ScratchJr]] also has blocks which are even more friendly for younger children to understand.
